  operate1: OPERATE
  operate2: We have people, budget and experience available to operate the block producer infrastructure. Our people have extensive experience in managing high profile banking, identity and website environments – and protecting them from cyberattacks including DDoS. We have been developing and operating trading platforms for multiple years. Our team is available 24x7.
  develop1: DEVELOP
  develop2: We want to invest in building infrastructure and distributed applications that offer real value for our community. Our investments will most likely go to apps and dapps on topics such as on-boarding, identity, reputation, security and usability of the platform.
  govern1: GOVERN
  govern2: We navigate on global human values such as freedom, privacy and property. And comply with the European rules that have translated these values into laws. This means e.g. that we work on a privacy-by-design basis, as required under EU law. We advise on and try to ensure contract and ownership compatibility within the existing legal framework.
  promote1: PROMOTE
  promote2: We organize meetups and workshops for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to evangelize the power of the concepts behind EOS. We also plan to help on-board companies by providing lectures and on-premise training. Our team of crypto specialists focuses on helping to build and operate the infrastructure to support the EOS community.

  heading2: Goedendag! We are EOS Amsterdam. Originating from the Netherlands, we  have always excelled at global trading and connecting the world. This goes back as far as the seventeenth century. Our habitat? That is the capital of this country – a prosperous city with a well-educated, liberal and internationally oriented population. Additionally, the Amsterdam Internet Exchange is close by. This is the second largest internet exchange in the world based on the number of connected members and amount of internet traffic.
  accountable1: ACCOUNTABLE & TRANSPARENT
  accountable2: Because we are a legal entity registered in the Netherlands, we can be held responsible for our actions, changes, failures and investments. We stay in close contact with our community. The Netherlands is a mature democracy and a stable member of the European Union.
  consistent1: CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVINGÍ
  consistent2: We consistently review our operations and infrastructure to find improvements. We believe that ßrepetitive and marginal improvements result in a qualitative service.

tech:
  heading1: TECH
  heading2: Working from Amsterdam means that we are as close as possible to the AMS-IX. Also, our multi-data center with fully synchronized nodes standby allows for high availability. With our server farm managed by an experienced team and 24x7 monitoring in place, we can ensure quick response times.<br><br>As EOS Amsterdam, we aim to avoid centralization by not using any of the popular cloud hosting platforms in the second stage. In the first stage, when the software only utilizes one CPU core, we will use the Google Cloud Platform to determine future sizing.<br><br>More information on our testnet servers can be found below.

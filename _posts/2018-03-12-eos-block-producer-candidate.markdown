EOS Amsterdam would like to officially introduce itself as a founding block producer candidate in the community launch of the [EOS.io](http://EOS.io) based blockchain.


## **Why EOS Amsterdam?**

We noticed the Netherlands is not represented in the coming launch of an EOS main-net. That is a shame! For the EOS network to function optimally, it is beneficial to have block producers distributed over all the [important internet hubs](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/intelligent-platform/visualizing-akamai/real-time-web-monitor.jsp) / [cables](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/). Amsterdam should be included, *The Amsterdam Internet Exchange is the [second largest Internet exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Exchange_Points_by_size) in the world* when measured by the number of connected members and by Internet traffic. The exchange and the Dutch come with knowledge, know-how, and a liberal mind that is open to the world.

The Amsterdam Internet Exchange is a modern symbol of the Dutch ability to connect the world. From the sixteenth century trading to today's businesses the Dutch have been frontrunners in using the advantages of continuously expanding worldwide networks. Amsterdam, our habitat, offers a well educated industrious and well organized internationally orientated people as well as lots of fun.


## **Mission**

Help to operate, promote and govern the EOS infrastructure to help people organize themselves into viable and thriving communities that secure and provide safe and honest interaction, respect the personal lives of its members and offer services that add a value determined in an open market spirit.

## **Values**

### **Independence**

EOS Amsterdam is designed to run an efficient and secure operation. The people, budget, and experience for operating and monitoring the block producer infrastructure are available. For this reason, EOS Amsterdam can operate as an organization that is largely independent. This results in the highest possible ratio of block producing rewards that can be invested in projects beneficial to the EOS community.


### **Transparency**

Every action, change, failure and investment is registered on-chain and communicated to our community. We believe in transparency. We will seek to ensure that the arbitration proceedings comply with the principles of a robust conflict resolving system, such as principles of independence, due process, and effectiveness.


### **Accountability**

EOS Amsterdam is a legal entity, registered in the Netherlands, and thus can be addressed and held responsible for any wrongdoing or not complying with the EOS constitution.


### **Consistency**

EOS Amsterdam will consistently review our operations and infrastructure to determine improvements. We believe in the marginal gains theory, which states that when you repetitively marginally improve a service you will end up with a quality service.


### **Plan for failure**

Our technical infrastructure is built on the principle that every service has a probability to fail, something all industry professionals working with (micro)services will have experienced. The principles guiding our operations will be monitoring, self-healing, and redundancy. We are familiar with the concept of [crash monkeys](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey), and used them in the to design our [HA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) infrastructure.


### **Reciprocity**

We believe that block producing should just happen, and in the end, EOS is a platform to run exciting new dApps! As we already have a full-time involvement in the EOS community we have an ear to the ground and are constantly interacting with the community and finding ways to give back to the community.


#### **Delegating monitoring and operations**

EOS Amsterdam delegates the 24x7 (security) monitoring and operations so it can focus on governance and projects beneficial to the EOS community.


#### **Build community (d)Apps**

EOS Amsterdam plans to invest in building infrastructure and distributed applications which represent real value to our community. Fields we want to invest in are on-boarding, identity, reputation, security and the usability of the platform.


#### **Promote**

EOS Amsterdam plans to invest in activities to promote EOS and help on-boarding companies by providing lectures and on-premise training. EOS Amsterdam will do this on location and already organizes meetups in The Netherlands.


#### **Distributed EOS engineering team**

EOS Amsterdam expects to see an increasing demand for highly skilled EOS software engineers. The roads, buildings, and bridges need to be constructed! And we have some very specific ideas, which will be announced in time, on how to inspire and organize this new breed of enthusiastic engineers with a mission!

### **Monitoring and security**

EOS Amsterdam is working together with [Kahuna](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kahuna/), a Managed Security Services Provider located in Amersfoort (Netherlands) & Valencia (Spain) handling the cybersecurity for companies, financial services, and the government.

Kahuna will secure, manage and monitor our block producer infrastructure 24x7.


### **Scaling plans**

To be able to scale and adapt to the requirements of the (exponentially) growing EOS platform we will need to adapt to the emerging requirements of the platform and balance this against the reserved rewards for block producing.


## **Community involvement**


### **Meetups and dApp development**

EOS Amsterdam is organizing [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/EOS-Amsterdam) to evangelize the power of the concepts behind EOS and is building a distributed team of crypto specialists focused on helping to build and operate the infrastructure to support the EOS community in a yet to be announced foundational EOS project.


### **University blocklab**

[Kahuna](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kahuna/) & EOS Amsterdam are planning to organize a block lab at one of the Universities to inspire and train people on the best blockchain known to man (at this time) for dApp development.


### **Evangelism**

EOS Amsterdam is an ambassador for the EOS blockchain. EOS Amsterdam organizes meetups for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors waiting to enter the chain we all believe in. We are working together with other blockchain initiatives in the Netherlands promoting EOS to general crypto enthusiasts. For example at the (almost exponentially) growing [Blockbar The Hague](https://www.meetup.com/blockbar/), see a [video of Boy Maas explaining EOS](https://d.tube/v/artakush/09yl53i9) to a group of people.
